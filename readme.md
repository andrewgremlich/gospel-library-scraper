# Gospel Library Scraper

An exploration of implementing a web scraper with Rust.

Also a way to find how to build static Markdown files.

Also a duplicate of [Node Gospel Library Scraper](https://github.com/andrewgremlich/node-gospel-library-scraper).

Currently only scrapes `/study/scriptures?lang=eng`.

## use

`cargo run` to get everything from scriptures of the gospel library.

Will output Markdown files to a `study/` folder in the present working directory.
